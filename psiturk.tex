\section{Introduction}


The ability to collect behavioral data from a large group of individuals
anonymously over the Internet has transformed the behavioral and social
sciences.  In addition to large scale experiments such as those
conducted by websites such as Facebook or 
Twitter~\citep[e.g.,][]{Chen:2013pb,Kramer:2014dq,Wu:2011sp}, many researchers
use online data collection to deploy ``traditional" experimental psychology
tasks.  The benefit of the online versions of traditional behavioral experiments include 
faster data collection and access to a potentially more diverse pool of participants. 
At the same time, conducting experiments online introduces a number of new 
technical and scientific challenges that must be addressed.

The project described in this paper, \textsf{psiTurk}, is an open-source framework of 
software and services that aims to address many of the technical challenges
involved in deploying experimental psychology experiments online.
It facilitates the creation, deployment, sharing, and replication of web-based experiments.
Study participants can be recruited via a number of methods including Amazon 
Mechanical Turk (AMT), which is currently the most popular platform for running 
paid human experiments online.

\begin{figure*}[tp]

(http://github.com/NYUCCL/psiTurk) and at its main webpage (\textsf{http://psiturk.org}). 
The commissioned logo reflects the community-built orientation of the project.  A 
core philosophy is that better scientific software developed can be developed 
with more diverse input from many programmers~\citep{Raymond:1999zt}}.
\label{fig:logo}
\end{figure*}

To briefly summarize, \textsf{psiTurk} provides features for serving an 
experiment on the web, saving experimental data to a database, and restricting the 
participant pool according to the experimenter's needs (e.g., to prevent non-naive 
participants from contaminating a study). It also provides an interface with AMT to 
create and test new projects as well as to manage and pay participants. Finally, in 
the spirit of the recent ``open science" movement \citep{Collaboration:2012vf},
it provides  an open-source \emph{experiment exchange} for sharing experiments 
that can be easily replicated and extended by other researchers.  The code for 
\textsf{psiTurk} is open source, hosted publicly at
\textsf{http://github.com/NYUCCL/psiTurk} and interested researchers can easily 
contribute to improvements and bug fixes (see Figure~\ref{fig:logo}).

The principal goal of this framework is to handle common technical 
challenges so that researchers can focus on the development and replication
of online experiments.  In this paper we present a high-level overview of the 
\textsf{psiTurk} framework and its advantages for running web-based experiments.
In supplement to this overview, \textsf{psiTurk} provides a large and continually
evolving set of documentation hosted online (\textsf{https://psiturk.org/docs}).
We begin with an overview of the issues involved in online 
behavioral research,  the AMT platform, and the specific challenges that \textsf{psiTurk} is designed to 
address.  We then  step through the core functionality of \textsf{psiTurk} and 
describe its role in both an experimenter's and participant's workflow.  Finally, we
consider some future directions for \textsf{psiTurk} and online experimentation in 
general.



\section{The challenges of web-based experimental behavioral research}

\begin{figure*}[tp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/combinedquestionsedited.pdf}
\caption{Reported uses, challenges, and benefits of online data collection as surveyed
by 201 behavioral researchers.}
\label{fig:survey}
\end{figure*}

It is easy to see why online experiments are an attractive option for behavioral 
scientists.  Compared to traditional methods of experimentation in the laboratory
they allow researchers to collect large data sets in a fraction of the time and at 
much lower cost (in terms of time, employment of research assistants, and typical 
compensation costs for participants).  Designing experiments for the web allows 
researchers to leverage the large set of software libraries developed to assist 
in the design of commercial web applications such as Node.js, JQuery, d3.js, 
and Bootstrap.  Such libraries can be used to design the look and flow of an 
experiment in ways 
that far exceed the capabilities of traditional experiment software developed 
in academia.  Additionally, such tools enable a much wider range of experiments, 
including more complicated interactive interfaces, or even multi-player games.

Still, there are a number of technical challenges to running experiments online.
For example, unlike in a laboratory setting, researchers have to 
deal with setting up a web server, recording data in a robust and secure way, 
and compensating participants over the Internet.  
Prior to the release of \textsf{psiTurk} version
2.0.0 (early 2014), we conducted an informal survey of behavioral researchers 
regarding their attitudes, concerns, and needs regarding online experimentation. 
To help introduce some of the core features and goals of \textsf{psiTurk} we 
quick summarize some of the findings from this survey.



\subsection{Informal survey of the challenges researchers face conducting online experiments}
 We collected responses from 201 researchers in psychology (58\%),
linguistics (16\%), marketing (7\%), neuroscience (6\%), and economics (4\%), most of 
whom had some experience collecting behavioral data online in their labs (85\%).  
Respondents were recruited via mailing lists devoted to behavioral science and psychology 
as well as blogs and social media. 

The survey questions asked respondents about their attitudes and opinions towards
online data collection as well as the features they would look for in a software package
that helps with online data collection.  In the interest of brevity we highlight some of the
most important questions and answer.

Survey respondents showed a clear interest in online data collection. Nearly all listed fast data
collection and large sample sizes as benefits of online data collection, with most
interested in the potential for lower costs and a more diverse population
(Figure~\ref{fig:survey}). Of researchers who had reviewed a paper which included data 
collected online, 59\% treated the data identically to data collected in the lab.


%\begin{figure*}[tp]

%\caption{Survey responses in answer to the question ``What are the major challenges 
% in using behavioral data collected online in research?" \hl{I suggest making this a full page 
% info graphic type thing that shows more of the interesting things in the survey that we 
% can use to open discussion of psiturk's features}}
%\label{fig:challenges}
%\end{figure*}

Respondents also felt that online data collected presented a set of unique challenges 
(Figure~\ref{fig:survey}).  Some felt that the data collected online was unreliable, or the
population unrepresentative. Many expressed that the experiment designs they were interested in did
not work well online, or that web technology is too complex. Researchers based
outside the US reported difficulty using services like Amazon Mechanical Turk.

\begin{table*}[tp]
\centering
\caption{Features the surveyed researchers desire in a software system for online data collection.}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/featuresTable.pdf}
\label{tab:features}
\end{table*}


While about half of respondents (56\%) listed Qualtrics, a service for conducting online surveys, 
as the tool they were \emph{currently} most likely to use, most respondents (79\%) expressed interest in 
being able to run full experiments that included multiple trials, fixation crosses, etc.
(Figure~\ref{fig:survey}). The vast majority (94\%) reported interest in new tools that 
simplified online data collection. A full list of the features researchers are looking for in a 
online data-collection system are shown in Table~\ref{tab:features}, along with a checklist 
showing which are currently handled by \textsf{psiTurk}.  Importantly, \textsf{psiTurk} successfully
meets many of the major challenges that researchers identified.


\section{psiTurk and Amazon Mechanical Turk} 

\textsf{psiTurk} was primarily designed to facilitate online data collection using
the Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) crowdsourcing platform (though, it can also be
used to run expereiments in a traditional lab setting).
\cite{Mason:2012xy} provide a general overview of AMT features of
interest to academic researchers.  A key feature of AMT is that it provides a way for researchers
to easily recruit and compensate individuals for online experiments.  
People who complete tasks (called Human Intelligence Tasks or \emph{HITs}), are 
called \emph{workers}, and people who post tasks are called \emph{requesters}.
Beyond providing a platform to connect requesters and workers, AMT places few restrictions 
on the type of work that can be requested and the amount paid per HIT.  Workers are 
paid a fixed amount for each HIT they complete; this amount is determined by the requester and
can be supplemented with bonus payments for good performance.

From a worker's perspective, the AMT website provides an up-to-date listing of HITs that 
are available, with a title, brief description, and payment amount.  A worker can click on a HIT to 
see its full \emph{advertisement} (an embedded webpage that is either hosted by
Amazon or the requester) and decide to accept the HIT. Once the HIT has been accepted,
the worker must complete it within a timeframe specified by the requester, or ``return'' the HIT
so that it may be completed by a different worker. The HIT may be completed either 
on a requester's own hosted service (i.e., a webpage 
external to the AMT site), or on the AMT website itself through the use of customized templates.
Upon completion, the worker ``submits'' the HIT, after which point the completed work must 
be approved by the requester before they are compensated.
In addition, some HITs offer bonus payments that are determined by the requester based 
on a worker's performance.

From a requester's perspective, AMT provides a web-based interface for creating/managing 
HITs and approving work that has been submitted.  In addition, they offer a ``sandbox" version 
of the platform in which HITs can be tested without paying live participants.
For basic tasks like surveys and open text fields, AMT offers a range of built-in templates that 
can be used to create experiments within the AMT website.  However, the degree of customization 
is limited for these templates. In particular, they do not support advanced experimental logic that is 
common to many psychology experiments (e.g., adapting the presentation of stimuli based on 
performance, or counterbalancing across a number of experimental variables).
In addition, they are limited to relatively simple forms of interaction and stimulus presentation.

For more complex tasks, a requester can provide a link to their own hosted web page or
web application which runs the 
experiment, saves the data, and only interfaces with AMT at the beginning of the task (receiving 
basic information about the worker) and at the end of the task (sending confirmation that the task 
has been completed).  Thus, these ``external HITs'' enable a much wider range of experiments at 
the cost of additional technical requirements.  \textsf{psiTurk} is designed to handle many of the 
complex requirements associated with ``external HITs'' so that researchers can more efficiently run 
these types of tasks.
% Specifically, it allows you to:
% 1. Run a web server for your experiment
% 2. Test your experiment
% 3. Interact with AMT to recruit, post HITs, filter, and pay participants (AMT workers)
% 4. Manage databases and export data



\section{What technical challenges is \textsf{psiTurk} designed to solve?}

The \textsf{psiTurk} platform is design to mitigate several of the technical complexities
involved in online experimentation, particularly using AMT.

\subsubsection{Web server and database management} 
To collect experimental data on the web, or specifically to run an external HIT on AMT, 
researchers minimally need a web server and database.  
The role of a web server is to respond to requests from participant's Internet browser 
for the experiment content.  The role of the database is to save the data provided by 
the participant.  Although less common in laboratory experiments, databases are 
necessary for online studies because it is impossible to save data to a participant's 
computer using a web page or web application: data must be stored on the server,
rather than the client.  In addition, multiple participants often complete an 
experiment concurrently which can result in file corruption if two people try to
write to the same file at the same time. Databases are specifically designed to 
mitigate this issue by managing concurrent reading and writing.
 
Setting up a webserver and database can be complex.  Some university Information
Technology departments
provide these types of services, but the technical infrastructure at other 
institutions is lacking.  \textsf{psiTurk} includes a custom webserver and database
as a basic feature of the software tool which can be run from any computer
including a standard office computer or laptop.  This allows data collection from
anywhere without the need for a dedicated server computer.  In addition, \textsf{psiTurk}
can be easily installed on free hosting services such as Amazon Web Services
or RedHat's OpenShift.  Data collected with \textsf{psiTurk} is stored at a location
chosen by the experimenter and never visible to the \textsf{psiturk.org} cloud
services or Amazon, protecting the privacy of participants and helping with IRB compliance.

An additional complication is that contemporary web browsers are increasingly security
focused.  In particular, certain browsers will not load content that is not properly 
signed with a SSL certificate and accessed with a \textsf{https://} request.  This
is often difficult to obtain from universities and can be costly from online
hosting companies.  \textsf{psiTurk} solves this problem on behalf of researchers by
using a cloud-based ``ad server'' which presents securely signed
content for users.  One way to think of the ad server is as a digital
version of a ``bulletin board'' which is used to advertise particular
studies within a university.  \textsf{psiTurk}
posts the text of an ad using a unique URL, and securely routes requests to this URL
back to the worker's browser.  If the worker decides to accept the HIT after seeing the ad,
they are forwarded to the researcher's local computer to complete the task; it is up to the
experimenter if this later content is encrypted or not. Thus, 
the \textsf{psiTurk} ad server acts as a bridge between AMT and 
a researcher's local computer (see Section~\ref{sec:adserver} for further information 
about the ad server). 


\subsubsection{Communicating with AMT}

When using AMT to recruit and compensate participants,
experimenters typically use the AMT website.  This often
involves a lot of manual, error-prone clicking.   \textsf{psiTurk}
has scripted many of the common
tasks that researchers have to do on AMT's website, including:
paying all participants, assigning bonus, checking the current
account balance, and monitoring the progress of an experiment.
This is accomplished via an interactive UNIX-based command
line tool (see below).
The goal of this tool is to help prevent errors in payments and
to save researchers considerable time.

\subsubsection{Programming an experiment}
\textsf{psiTurk} provides a number of features which help researchers implement 
experiments.  These include a Javascript library (psiturk.js), basic HTML templates 
for commonly used components (e.g., consent forms and instruction screens), 
and an user-contributed ``experiment exchange'' where researchers can share the code for their \textsf{psiTurk}-compatible
projects (\textsf{http://psiturk.org/ee}). 

The psiturk.js javascript library provides basic functions for recording data and sending it back to the \textsf{psiTurk} server,
preloading pages and images, as well as some basic functions for looping through instructions
screens and providing (and recording) informed consent.
However, the \textsf{psiTurk} framework is \emph{not} designed as a generic
programming interface for building 
experiments (e.g., it does not provide code for widgets such as sliders or buttons) and assume
researchers will use some basic Javascript, HTML, and CSS to design their experiment.  Instead, \textsf{psiTurk}'s
philosophy is that general purpose javascript libraries available online for creating dynamic content (e.g., jquery or
Twitter's Bootstrap library) provide the most powerful and well-documented set of features.  Instead, \textsf{psiTurk}
aims to help share code and propagate ``best practices'' among the research community.
This later goal is supported by the online ``experiment exchange''.
The source code for projects in the exchange can be downloaded and modified for a new use,
replicated directly, or can simply provide example of code implementing a particular 
feature.  In addition to the exchange, \textsf{psiTurk} also includes a complete working example 
experiment that can be used as a template for new projects.

%That is, it requires that the experimenter knows some basic JavasScipt, HTML, and CSS to code the logic and looks of a new study.


\subsubsection{Recruiting, filtering, and instructing participants}
Finally, \textsf{psiTurk} has a number of features for controlling the recruitment
of participants which can contribute to higher quality control.
For example, \textsf{psiTurk} offers basic capabilities for assigning workers to different experimental conditions 
and counterbalancing different aspects of the experiment.
In addition, it allows experimenters to filter workers in particular ways.  For example, through \textsf{psiTurk},
is it possible to exclude participation by workers using certain devices (such as phones or tablets) or browsers
which are known to have compatibility issues with the experimenter's design (for example,
Firefox or Internet Explorer).  \textsf{psiTurk} also allows researchers to prevent a AMT worker from 
participating in the same experiment more than once (which might otherwise be tempting when
large financial rewards are offered).  Future versions of \textsf{psiTurk} may also allow researchers to 
block AMT workers who have completed certain \textsf{psiTurk} experiments in the past, such as
any similar experiment with a similar task~\citep[see][for a discussion about non-naivety amongst AMT workers]{chandler2014nonnaivete}.


With these general features in mind, we now turn to a more detailed overview of the 
\textsf{psiTurk} platform.

\begin{figure*}[tp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=.40]{figures/psiturk-components.pdf}
\caption{The three core components of the \textsf{psiTurk} system.  }
\label{fig:components}
\end{figure*}


\section{Key components of the \textsf{psiTurk} platform}

The overall structure of the \textsf{psiTurk} platform is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:components}
and can be conceptualized as involving three components.
First, there are a collection of software tools which run locally on a user's
local computer or server.  These local components include a command line tool and 
a web application server (which provides both a customizable webserver and 
database solution).  Next, \textsf{psiTurk} relies currently on Amazon
Mechanical Turk to handle the recruitment and compensation of participants.
Finally, the \textsf{psiturk.org} cloud based component includes a hosted ``ad server" 
and the experiment exchange.  In the following sections we highlight the important 
functions of each component.

\subsection{Local computer or server}

\subsubsection{Command line tool}
\label{sec:cli}

When using \textsf{psiTurk}, the researcher runs the \textsf{psiturk} 
interactive UNIX-based command line tool on a local computer, such as a laptop or lab computer.
This tool is used to issue commands, and to interact
with the Amazon Mechanical Turk system and with the \textsf{psiTurk} cloud.  
The design choice of a command line interface was 
selected to make it easier to add new functionality to the system quickly without 
needing to design time consuming GUI elements; thus, the set of
available commands continues to grow. Furthermore, the command line can be run in
a ``script'' mode, which allows multiple commands to be run automatically at once
and allowing for even further automation of an experiment.
Example uses of the command line tool include checking the user's Amazon
Mechanical Turk account balance, paying participants, and creating new HITs.
The command line has the capability to give automated bonus payments to 
participants based on a function designed by the experimenter. This feature is 
particularly helpful since the AMT website requires bonuses to be entered by hand 
for each participant individually.


\subsubsection{Web application server (webserver + database)}

The command line tool is also used to interact with the web application server.
The web application server handles the logic determining which pages to show
to a participant at different stages of the experiment.  \textsf{psiTurk} comes with
a default web application which implements many important features commonly
needed by experiments (e.g., checking that a user hasn't already done the experiment,
recording and saving data to a centralized database).  In addition, the web application itself
server can be heavily customized to support functions that are difficult to code in JavaScript,
or easily exploitable by savvy participants. Such customizations might be as simple as changing
the way that bonuses are assigned to participants, but they can also allow for much
more complex experimental designs. For example, \textsf{psiTurk} allowed us to create an
experiment where a cognitive model is fit to participant's data in real time and used to determine the sequence of future
trials in the experiment.

\subsection{Amazon Mechanical Turk and Amazon Web Services}

Amazon Mechanical Turk's servers handle the recruitment of participants via
its crowdsourced labor force.  It also handles the transfers of money between Requesters and
Workers.  Finally, it provides a listing of available HITs which workers can browse 
through.  Amazon Mechanical Turk is one part of a larger collection
of cloud-based services provided by Amazon via the Amazon Web Services.
For example, by using the \textsf{psiTurk} command line tool, users can create a
database server running on Amazon's cloud with a few short commands.  This database
can then be used instead of a local database solution.

\subsection{\textsf{psiturk.org} cloud services}
In addition to the command-line tool and the web application server, \textsf{psiTurk}
provides a few web services that are continuously running on a separate web server.
Most important of these is the psiTurk Secure Ad Server.  When a user
creates a new HIT and wishes to post it to AMT, typically one advertises the
study to potential participants (explaining how long the task will take and how
much it will pay).  As mentioned earlier, these ``ads'' will not correctly display
in worker's browsers unless they are encrypted using SSL.  The \textsf{psiturk.org}
ad server allows users of the psiturk system to host ads on the \textsf{https://psiturk.org}
website which are encrypted.  These ads are what appear in the browsable listing
on the Amazon Mechanical Turk website.
As mentioned earlier, the psiturk Experiment Exchange provides
a open-source repository of \textsf{psiTurk}-compatible experiments which can be 
easily downloaded.  The coordination of these downloads is handled by the \textsf{psiturk.org} cloud.

%Complete documentation and tutorials are available at http://psiturk.org/docs, including instructions for installing the software.

\section{Requirements and initial setup - (AC)}
This section describes the requirements and installation steps that are required to successfully setup psiTurk and run
HITs on Mechanical Turk. Note that details of these steps may change over time and will be updated at \textsf{http://psiturk.readthedocs.org}.

\subsection{System requirements}
psiTurk is designed to run on UNIX systems (including Mac OS X, BSD, and Linux) that satisfy the following requirements:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A working Python installation of version 2.7 (Python 3 is not currently supported)
\item The \texttt{pip} package manager 
\item A command line tool (like \emph{Terminal} in Mac OS X)
\item A web browser (ideally one that provides web developer tools, like Firefox, Safari, or Chrome)
\end{enumerate}

To satisfy the Python requirements, we recommend using an existing distribution like \emph{Enthought} or \emph{Anaconda}. These are free
Python distributions that ship with a range of useful packages, including the \texttt{pip} package manager. 

\subsection{AWS credentials}
An Amazon Web Services (AWS) account is required to use AMT as a requester. A new account can be created at \textsf{http://aws.amazon.com/mturk/}. 
To set up an account, note that requesters
must provide a U.S. billing address, so this may bar researchers out of the U.S. from create an account. 

After setting up an account, psiTurk users must retrieve their AWS credentials, which include an \emph{access key id} and a
\emph{secret access key}. These can be retrieved and (re-)generated at \textsf{https://console.aws.amazon.com}.
Eventually, these credentials will be entered in the \texttt{.psiturkconfig} file, as explained below.


\subsection{psiTurk credentials}
Additionally, a \textsf{psiTurk} account must be created at \textsf{https://psiturk.org/register}, which allows users to 
post ads on \textsf{psiTurk}'s ad server. A new user must then obtain a set of \textsf{psiTurk} credentials which can be found in 
the ``API Keys'' menu item in the drop-down at the top right hand of the page.
These credentials will also be placed in \texttt{.psiturkconfig} (see below).

\subsection{Installation}
\textsf{psiTurk} is installed using the python package manager \texttt{pip}. In a terminal window, type (excluding the dollar sign):
\footnote{Depending on the user's permissions, this command may have to be prefaced with \texttt{sudo}.}

\begin{lstlisting}
$ pip install psiturk
\end{lstlisting}

Alternatively, psiTurk can be installed directly from GitHub, which holds the latest stable
release in the \texttt{master} branch, and the latest development version in the \texttt{dev} branch. 
To install from \texttt{master}, for example, type:

\begin{lstlisting}
$ pip install git+git://github.com/NYUCCL/psiTurk.git@master
\end{lstlisting}

The psiTurk installation automatically creates a global config file, \texttt{.psiturkconfig}, in a user's home directory. 
This file must then be edited to include the AWS and psiTurk credentials of the specific user. 

\subsection{Optional: Adding SQL database}
By default, psiTurk includes a basic database solution called \emph{SQLite}. This solution
will work well for HITs that only require light traffic, but it does not handle
multiple concurrent queries well: there is a real danger of data loss when a SQLite database is accessed at the same time by different users. 
It is therefore recommended to set up a more robust database solution, like a
MySQL database, especially if a researcher wants to run many participants simultaneously.
\hl{JBH: earlier it was mentioned this could be done from the psiturk command line --
maybe we should briefly mention specifics of how to do that here?}

\section{Getting started with \textsf{psiTurk}}

The following section provides a basic overview of how to use psiTurk,
explaining the various steps required of new users of the system along with
some details about how the various components described above interact.

\subsection{Configuration and project structure - (AR)}

A new \textsf{psiTurk} project can be initialized in the current directory using (without the dollar sign):

\begin{lstlisting}
$ psiturk-setup-example
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent This creates a new directory containing an example experiment,
which can be used as a template for more sophisticated designs.
The project directory typically includes the following files (though some are only
created after the experiment is run for the first time):

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{config.txt}: a text file containing settings for the current experiment, including:

\begin{itemize}
\item Metadata about the experiment that is displayed to workers on the AMT website (title, description, etc.)
\item Restrictions on which workers can accept the HIT, including geographic location (e.g., limiting to US workers only), AMT-specific qualifications (e.g., a worker's proportion of past work that has been approved), and web browsers that are permitted.
\item Database information (SQLite, by default)
\item Server parameters (URL, port number)
\item Task parameters (e.g., number of conditions)
\end{itemize}


\item \texttt{custom.py}: a Python file containing user-created ``routes'', so that new server-side functionality can be added to the psiTurk web server. \hl{JBH: I think there needs to be an explanation of what routes are}

\item \texttt{participants.db}: the SQLite database (if SQLite is being used)

\item \texttt{server.log}: a log of any messages from the experiment server (\emph{not} from the actual experiment code)

\item \texttt{static/} a directory containing experiment files, including JavaScript, CSS, and images.

\item \texttt{templates/} a directory containing HTML files associated with the experiment 
\end{itemize}

Setting up a new experiment thus entails 1) editing the settings in \texttt{config.txt}, and 2) modifying the contents of the \texttt{static} and \texttt{templates} directories to reflect your experimental design (note that programming the experiment requires at least some basic web programming skills, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).

The remaining files are only necessary in order to debug server errors (\texttt{server.log}), add new server-side functionality (\texttt{custom.py}), or to access saved data (\texttt{participants.db}).

\subsection{Command line interface: Managing HITs and serving the experiment - (AR)}

PsiTurk runs as a command line interface (CLI) within a standard terminal window, as described in Section\ref{sec:cli}.

There are several advantages to designing psiTurk as a simple CLI beyond its efficiency of use. This
design makes the user interface code clear and easy to read and write, allowing newcomers to quickly
understand and contribute to the open-source project. Integrating a new feature into the interface
is as simple as describing the syntax and functioning of a new command. The CLI also ensures that
psiTurk is easy to interact with not just on a laptop or desktop but also on a remote server or in
the cloud, where users may have terminal-only access.
 
Tab completion makes it quick to type commands, and the \texttt{help} command can be used to show
details on the usage of any command. 
The straightforward and consistent syntax of the CLI allows
users to perform a wide variety of tasks---from creating HITs and paying workers, to launching Amazon
Web Services database instances, to opening an experiment in a browser for debugging---that
would otherwise be spread across a number of websites and programs. In most cases, a user of the
psiTurk CLI will never have to log into the MTurk website except to add money to their MTurk
requester account.


Entering
\texttt{psiturk} at the command line in any directory containing a psiTurk project launches the
psiTurk CLI.
The psiTurk CLI features a colorized prompt that provides important information at a glance, including
whether the server is running, the current mode (``live" or ``sandbox", and the number of HITs currently running on AMT:

\begin{lstlisting}
[psiTurk server:off mode:sdbx #HITs:0]$
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent In some examples below, this prompt is truncated as \texttt{[psiTurk]\$} to indicate commands that occur within the psiTurk CLI, while commands that are entered at the user's standard command line are preceded simply by \texttt{\$}.


\subsubsection{Example CLI usage}
Commands are organized into groups based on their function, following a general ``\texttt{command subcommand
arguments}'' format. For example, one can create a HIT by typing 

% \noindent\lstinline+[psiTurk]$ hit create+
% $<\# assignments> <\$ amount> <duration>$
\begin{lstlisting}
[psiTurk]$ hit create
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent which launches an interactive prompt for number of assignments, payment per HIT, and HIT duration. After creating one or more HITs, one can list any active HITs with:

\begin{lstlisting}
[psiTurk]$ hit list --active
\end{lstlisting}

The experiment server is launched using

\begin{lstlisting}
[psiTurk]$ server on
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent which opens the port specified in the project configuration file.
The experiment server will then respond to incoming requests, assuming that the port is publicly accessible.
This requires a static IP to prevent the experiment's URL from changing.
Users without a static IP address can use a dynamic DNS service to forward requests to their dynamic IP.
If the system running psiTurk is behind a router, the router must be configured to forward requests on the same port.

During the development of an experiment, the current code can be tested using:

\begin{lstlisting}
[psiTurk]$ debug
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent which will open a new browser window in which the current experiment can be tested.

%Can restart the server with \texttt{server restart} or open the server log with \texttt{server log}. 

The sandbox mode is active by default, which means that calling \texttt{hit create} will submit a HIT to the AMT sandbox website.
The experimenter can then test the experiment from the perspective of a worker before making it publicly available.
Once the experiment is ready for real workers, the \texttt{mode} command can be used to switch to ``live" mode, after which newly created HITs will be submitted to the main AMT site.

\caption{How the Secure Ad Server works.}
\label{fig:adserver}
\end{figure*}


\subsection{The Secure Ad Server}
\label{sec:adserver}

As described briefly above, the psiturk.org cloud service
provides a ``Secure Ad Server."  The term ``ad" in this context
refers to a small HTML page the describes the details and
requirements of a given experiment.  The ad is the
first interaction that a \textsf{psiTurk} user has with a
potential subject and is thus the gateway to subject recruitment.
Ads are in many ways analogous to hanging a poster or flyer 
around a university building in order to recruit participants.
It's easy to overlook the importance of a good ad, and making that ad
visible to as many participants as possible.

An overview of the flow of running an experiment using
\textsf{psiTurk} and the Secure Ad Server is illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:adserver}.  When a researcher using \textsf{psiTurk}
runs the \texttt{hit create} command, the current contents of the local
\texttt{templates/ad.html} file are uploaded to the psiturk.org cloud (see
the right panel of Figure~\ref{fig:adserver}).
This will create a unique custom URL for the experiment (an example might be
\texttt{https://ad.psiturk.org/view/90812390123091823}) which
allows anyone on the Internet to view the contents of the \texttt{ad.html}
file which was uploaded.  A different URL is create each time \texttt{hit create}
is run and there is no limit to the number of ads a user can create.  A list
of all of a users ads is available in the psiturk.org dashboard (\texttt{http://psiturk.org/dashboard}).
Critically the ad URL is encrypted and
securely signed with an appropriate SSL certificate ensuring that all
web browsers will successfully display the webpage\footnote{SSL certification has recently become a requirement for hosting content within an \texttt{iframe} on \texttt{mturk.com}.}.  This new custom URL is then passed
on to AMT by the \texttt{hit create} command as the ``location" of
the selected HIT.  As is visible in the right panel of Figure~\ref{fig:adserver}
when a user in the AMT "crowd" labor workforce views a HIT on the AMT
website, it loads the ad from the psiturk.org cloud server.  If the user accepts
the hit, a link is provided to the worker which pops open a new browser
window.  This URL points directly at the location of the user's local computer
or server.  After this hand off occurs all data transmitted between the worker
and requester is direct meaning that the psiturk.org cloud server does not
process or see the user's experimental data.  This is important for many IRBs
particular if an experiment involves sensitive materials.

Besides the convenience of the Secure Ad Server in terms of providing
SSL signed URLs, the Secure Ad Server does track statistics about the
number of workers who viewed and ad but decided to not accept it, the
number who accepted it, the number who completed the task, etc...
These statistics are made available on the psiturk.org dashboard
and can be an additional source of information for experimenters.


\subsection{Javascript library \emph{psiturk.js}}

The javascript library \emph{psiturk.js} enables interaction with the server from the client-side (javascript) experiment code.
The goal of the library is to handle the most common functionality of psiTurk-based web experiments, without imposing any additional requirements on the structure or design of the experiments themselves.
Researchers can use any third-party javascript libraries to design their experiment, while relying on \emph{psiturk.js} for common functions, including saving data and notifying the server of changes in a participant's status.

Listing~\ref{code.lst} shows a condensed version of the javascript code from the Stroop example experiment.
This is used in the following sections to illustrate how experiment code uses functions from \emph{psiturk.js} in order to interact with the psiTurk server.
For the full, functional version, see the file \texttt{static/js/task.js} in the example experiment directory.

\subsubsection{Initialization}

When the experiment files are requested from the psiTurk server, the following global variables are also set (see \texttt{templates/exp.html}):

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{uniqueId}: a unique identifier for the participant
\item \texttt{adServerLoc}: an experiment-specific URL on the Ad Server
\item \texttt{mode}: the current mode (debug, sandbox, or live)
\item \texttt{condition}: experimental condition
\item \texttt{counterbalance}: counterbalancing code, used to vary design elements that are not related to main manipulation 
\end{itemize}

A \texttt{psiTurk} object must be initialized based on these global variables (line 2).
These variables can also be used to change the experimental logic.
For example, a common requirement is to change the stimulus set or design based on the condition or counterbalance codes that have been assigned by the psiTurk server (lines 4-5).

Following instantiation, the \texttt{psiTurk} object can be used to preload a list of HTML pages that reside in the \texttt{templates} directory of the experiment (lines 8-9).
This allows a new page to be displayed using a single command (line 34), which replaces the body of the window with the content in the specified HTML file.
The \texttt{psiTurk} object also has functions for preloading images (in order to avoid server requests in the middle of the experiment when an image is displayed) and a basic structure for presenting a series of HTML pages (e.g., for an instructional phase).

\subsubsection{Tracking a participant's progress in an experiment} 

psiTurk records changes in a participant's status as they move through an experiment. 
Some of these status changes are automatic, e.g., when a participant is assigned to a condition or if they quit an experiment early. 
Two additional status changes are initiated by the client-side experiment code using \emph{psiturk.js} functions.
First, since experiments typically begin with an instructional phase, calling the function \texttt{psiTurk.finishInstructions()} upon completion of this phase will save the participant's status as having begun the main experiment.
If the participant attempts to quit the experiment after that point, they will receive a warning that they will not be able to restart the experiment and may forgo payment.
Second, successful completion of the experiment is signaled by calling \texttt{psiTurk.completeHIT()}, which closes the experiment and redirects the participant to the AMT page to submit their HIT.

\subsubsection{Saving experimental data} 

The experimenter can save data in two formats.
\texttt{psiTurk.recordTrialData} takes any JSON object as input and appends it to a list of ``trial" data.
This data structure is meant for sequential data that may be collected over the course of multiple trials or blocks, where each line corresponds to a new measurement.
However, the format of each entry is defined by the experimenter and is saved in the database as a single JSON object (see line 20).
Each new entry is automatically time-stamped at the time that \texttt{psiTurk.recordTrialData} is called.

In contrast, \texttt{psiTurk.recordUnstructuredData} is used to record $(key, value)$ pairs, where the key is uniquely defined within the experiment (see line 43).
This format is useful for survey questions, randomly generated experiment parameters, or other one-time measurements, e.g., (\emph{Age}: 24).

Importantly, both functions above simply record the data in the appropriate format on the client-side (i.e., within the \texttt{psiTurk} javascript object).
When the experimenter wishes to save the data to the server they call \texttt{psiTurk.saveData()}, at which point both sets of data are sent to the server to be recorded in the database.
\texttt{psiTurk.saveData()} can also be called with functions that will be executed upon either success or failure of the server request.
For example, if the final save request is successful, the experiment can be terminated with \texttt{psiTurk.completeHIT()} passed as a callback (see lines 56-63).  

\subsubsection{Automatic recording of browser interactions}
 
One general limitation of web experiments is greater uncertainty about a participant's testing environment and engagement with the experiment.
Unlike lab computers where most undesired behaviors can be prevented, a web participant is always able to close a web browser, switch to different applications, or change other aspects of their experience.
However, standard methods exist for recording a user's interaction with a web browser, and this data can be useful for 1) tracking how an experiment was actually displayed, and 2) the level of a participant's engagement.

For example, although it is possible to control the initial size of a browser window, a web participant can change the dimensions of the window, potentially obscuring or altering the displayed elements.
\emph{psiturk.js} automatically records these changes in the size of the window.
Similarly, the participant can choose to switch focus away from the experiment window (e.g., to another browser window or a different application).
\emph{psiturk.js} automatically records every time that the experiment window loses and gains the participant's focus.
This ``event data" is saved to the database whenever \texttt{psiTurk.saveData} is invoked, without any additional action on the part of the experimenter. \\

            }, 
            error: prompt_resubmit});
	});
};
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Experiment exchange}

A significant advantage of web-based experiments is the potential for low-friction replication and extension. 
The \emph{Experiment Exchange} (http://psiturk.org/ee) facilitates the sharing of experiments that have been built to run using psiTurk, acting as an ``app store" for psiTurk-compatible designs.
Once an experiment has been completed, a researcher can submit the following information to register their experiment on the exchange:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A Github repository containing the project code
\item Metadata about the experiment, including a title, description, and keywords
\item The DOI for the paper describing the results of the experiment (if any)
\item The version of psiTurk that was used to run the experiment
\end{enumerate}


Metadata associated with an experiment allows other researchers to discover it through the psiTurk website.
A publicly available experiment can then be downloaded using the following command in the terminal:

\begin{lstlisting}
$ psiturk-install <experiment-specific-id>
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent with the experiment-specific identifier found on the exchange page.
If psiTurk is already configured on the user's system, the downloaded experiment will run without further changes, and can then act as a starting point for direct replication or extensions.
Modified versions can then be re-run using the same population via AMT, thereby minimizing the potential for experimenter-specific biases.

Other initiatives (e.g., the Open Science Framework, https://osf.io) also aim to improve the transparency, reproducibility, and efficiency of research through centralized services, but are less focused on the specific technology stack used to run online experiments.
In contrast, the psiTurk experiment exchange links together experiments that can be run within a common framework.
As a result, existing experiments can serve as examples to help new researchers learn to code for the web; they shorten the development time necessary (especially for popular experimental paradigms); and the exchange facilitates communication between researchers with similar interests.

\section{Limitations and future directions (TMG)}

As mentioned above, psiTurk faces some challenges inherent to all online data collection and may not be the right choice for
researchers that require a very controlled experimental setup. But what are the limitations of psiTurk specifically?

One restriction is that it's currently designed to only work with Amazon Mechanical Turk. A common worry with AMT is the unrepresentativeness of
its subject pool (in terms of demographics and geography), as well as the fact that certain experimental protocols are now too well-known 
to workers to guarantee naive
participants~\citep{chandler2014nonnaivete}. These concerns are often not relevant for basic psychology research, but some experimenters may nevertheless
look for alternatives to AMT. Many psiTurk features (i.e. the web server, data base, and psiturk.js) are general
enough to facilitate running experiments on other platforms, too, but it would require some customization of certain AMT-specific functionality. 
Researchers who decide
to use psiTurk on another platform could contribute such changes to the github repository (https://github.com/NYUCCL/psiTurk) to make them
available to the community.


Another limitation is that psiTurk only runs on UNIX systems, like Linux and Mac OS, and can thus not be used on Windows computers. To meet this 
challenge, one option for Windows users is to use a cloud-based computing service to run psiTurk and host experiments. There exist
multiple free or low-cost options, such as Amazon Web Services (http://aws.amazon.com), or OpenShift (https://www.openshift.com). 
The installation steps and setup may diverge slightly from the standard procedure but 
 the psiTurk documentation already contains additional installation instructions for OpenShift. In the future, we hope to extend support  and 
documentation to a wider range of cloud computing options.

Another future direction is to extend the counterbalancing capabilities of psiTurk. Currently, the built-in counterbalancing algorithm
simply aims to assign participants equally to different cells.  However, this equal assignment method can be problematic if, for instance, 
one group has a higher drop-out rate than the others (a problem rarely encountered in the lab). 
In that case the high drop-out group will need to receive
more participants to equalize the difference and thus assignment probabilities will no longer be equal across groups. We are
currently working on alternative counterbalancing algorithms that keep assignment probabilities equal (which may then lead to unequal
number of participants) to avoid this problem. \hl{Not quite sure what the current status is here. May need updating and maybe mention PlanOut
if that's still relevant.}


One exciting prospect of running online experiments is to let multiple participants interact to study coordination
or group behavior. Currently psiTurk does not offer its own tool to facilitate such multi-person experiments, but we would like to
add support for it in the future, using web-sockets or other protocols that enable communication between users.

\hl{Some small features not mentioned yet:

Automate catch trials? How far did the worker get? Do we count them in the N? 

Limiting/throttling number of people doing the experiment at once

Video support}





\subsection{Remaining challenges}
Some of the concerns raised by survey respondents are inherent to online data collection or the AMT platform and therefore \textsf{psiTurk} does
not address them.
It is worth pointing out, however, that the common concern about data reliability may be somewhat exaggerated based on recent studies that have successfully replicated a wide range of classic cognitive psychology findings using AMT data~\citep{crump2013evaluating}. Interestingly, this study also found that increasing worker payment had no effect on reliability, suggesting that even 
at low payment levels data quality was high. 

On the other hand, there clearly exist experimental protocols that simply are not amenable to online
experimentation. Experiments that require very fine-grained temporal control over stimulus presentation, for example, 
may be unsuited because browsers will not be able to reliably display content fast enough if the presentation time
becomes too short~\citep{crump2013evaluating}.
Similarly, any experiment that requires control over a participant's screen size, resolution, or distance from the screen will be problematic due to the nature of the web browsing environment.
One advantage of psiTurk is that
it automatically collects data on worker's interaction with the experiment window, that is, if and when the window was resized and
if and when the user switched tabs or windows. 
This kind of data can be used to evaluate a worker's level of engagement while completing the task.

% Requires careful consideration depending on the specific experimental design.
We will continue to discuss these challenges at the end of the paper.
